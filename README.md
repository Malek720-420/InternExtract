InternExtract: AI-Powered Job Offer Data Extractor
InternExtract is a desktop application built with Electron that intelligently extracts key information from job and internship offers. It uses the Gemini API to parse unstructured text and PDFs, presenting the data in a structured format. The application also provides a seamless way to save extracted data to a personal Firestore database and export it as a PDF document.

PDF & Text Support: Accepts both pasted text and uploaded PDF files as input.

Firestore Database Integration: Saves all extracted data to a personal Firestore database, allowing you to build a history of job offers you've analyzed.

Anonymous Authentication: Securely saves data on a per-user basis using Firebase's Anonymous Authentication, so no login is required.
